# DOCX to PDF Converter 📄➡️📑

A simple Python tool to **convert Word (.docx) files into PDF** in batch mode.  
It keeps everything organized with three folders:

- `input/` → Place your `.docx` files here  
- `outputPdfs/` → Converted `.pdf` files will be saved here  
- `convertedDocs/` → Original `.docx` files are moved here after conversion  

This ensures no duplicates are processed on the next run.

## 🚀 Features
- Batch converts multiple `.docx` files in one run  
- Automatically organizes files into input, output, and archive folders  
- Prints a summary report after each run  
- No duplicate processing — converted docs are moved away
